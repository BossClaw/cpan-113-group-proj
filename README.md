## How to Play

1. **Choose your programming languages**  
   Select one or more languages. The game will use real keywords from these selections.

2. **Watch for enemies**  
   Evil bugs will appear on the right side of the screen and begin moving toward your mainframe.

3. **Type the word correctly**  
   Each bug displays a keyword. Type it exactly and press **Enter** to attack.

   - Correct entries reduce the enemy's HP.
   - Incorrect entries or failed inputs result in a missed attack and spawn more enemy.

4. **Protect your mainframe**  
   If an enemy reaches the firewall or mainframe, you take damage. When your HP drops to zero, the game ends.

5. **Progress through increasing difficulty**  
   As you survive longer, enemies use longer and more complex keywords. Some bugs may become stronger or faster.

6. **Use the virtual keyboard**  
   A virtual keyboard highlights your key presses as visual feedback. Alternate layout support may be added in future versions.

7. **End of game: Continue or quit**  
   Once the game ends (win or lose), you’ll have the option to enter your initials if your score qualifies for the leaderboard.
